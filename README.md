### More About Me
In my free time, I enjoy designing and developing applications for the mobile market. My ultimate goal is to fuse advanced technologies like AI with user-centric designs to create software that isn't just functional but truly transformative. 
Softwares like Ebay and Instagram inspire me - the ability to fuse together AI search and target customers by their needs are blowing my mind.
